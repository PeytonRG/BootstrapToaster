# bootstrap-toast.js
Plug &amp; play generator for Bootstrap toasts.

## To-Do
1. Add Documentation
2. Add configuration to disable toast elapsed timers (ex. "just now", "1m ago")
3. Update theming function to remove inline styles on toast template, so it is possible to re-enable auto theme switching after forcing light/dark theme. I cannot imagine why this would be wanted, but it is an oversight not to support it.
